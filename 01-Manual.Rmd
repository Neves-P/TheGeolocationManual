# Structure of the manual {-}

This manual should allow users with limited knowledge in R coding to perform a state-of-the-art analysis of geolocator data. Thus, we start with the very basics of loading packages  and data \@ref(loadingData) Starting with the initial data editing steps, which we call twilight annotation \@ref(twilight), we provide instructions on how to use several prominent analysis packages, illustrate the general analysis workflow using example data, and provide some recommendations for how to visualize and present results. We do not cover every available analysis package but focus on what we percieve to be the most frequently used tools, which are GeoLight \@ref(GeoLight), probGLS \@ref(probGLS), SGAT \@ref(SGAT) and FLightR \@ref(FLightR). The manual concludes with a recommendation for using Movebank as a data repository for geolocator tracks \@ref(movebank).
