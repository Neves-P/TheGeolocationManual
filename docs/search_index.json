This manual is part of the following publication and has been written by the same group of authors: Simeon Lisovski, Silke Bauer, Martins Briedis, Kiran Danjahl-Adams, Sarah Davidson, Christoph Meier, Lykke Pedersen, Julia, Karagicheva, Benjamin Merkel, Janne Ouwehand, Michael T. Hallworth, Eldar Rakhimberdiev, Michael Sumner, Caz Taylor, Simon Wotherspoon, Eli Bridge (201X) The Nuts and Bolts of Light-Level Geolocation Analyses. Journal X:xxx-xxx. Geolocation by light is a method of animal tracking that uses small, light-detecting data loggers (referred to as geolocators) to determine the locations of animals based on the light environment they move through. Technological and fieldwork issues aside, effective use of light level geolocation requires translation of a time series of light levels into geographical locations. Geographical locations that are derived from light-level data are subject to error which directly arises from noise in the light-level data, i.e. unpredictable shading of the light sensor due to weather or the habitat (Lisovski et al. 2012). Although light-level geolocation has provided a wealth of new insights into the annual movements of hundreds of bird species and other taxa, researchers struggle with the analytical steps that are needed to obtain location estimates, interpret them, present their results, and document what they have done. This manual has been written by some of the leading experts in geolocator analysis and is based on material created for several international training workshops. It offers code and experience that we have accumulated over the last decade, and we hope that this collection of analysis using different open source software tools (R packages) helps both newcomers and experienced users of light-level geolocation. Acknowledgements We want to acknowledge all people that have been involved in the development of geolocator tools as well as all participants of the many international geolocator workshops. Furthermore, we like to acknowledge Steffen Hahn and Felix Liechti organisewho organised a first workshop of the analysis of geolocator data from songbirds back in 2011. This workshop has been financially supported by the Swiss Ornithological Institute and the Swiss National Science Foundation. The National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) has supported two meetings with experts in geolocator analysis in 2012 ans 2013 and many of the tools that are discussed in this manual were kick started at these meetings. We want to thank James Fox from Migrate Technology Ltd. as well as the US National Science Foundation for contiouing financial support to develop tools and organise workshops.

["structure.html", "Chapter 1 Structure of the manual The datasets Reproducing the analyses", " Chapter 1 Structure of the manual This manual should allow users with limited knowledge in R coding to perform a state-of-the-art analysis of geolocator data. Thus, we start with the very basics of loading packages and data 3 Starting with the initial data editing steps, which we call twilight annotation 4, we provide instructions on how to use several prominent analysis packages, illustrate the general analysis workflow using example data, and provide some recommendations for how to visualize and present results. We do not cover every available analysis package but focus on what we percieve to be the most frequently used tools, which are GeoLight 5, probGLS 6, SGAT 7 and FLightR 8. The manual concludes with a section on data repositories such as Movebank that allows storing and shring geolocator tracks 9. The datasets To illustrate the capabilities of the different packages, discuss the potential pitfalls, and provide some recommendations, we will use raw geolocator data from four individuals of different species. All used tag data and the results as well as the code for the analyses has been uploaded onto Movebank unter study: xxxx. TagID Species Folder Tag type M034 Red-backed Shrike LanCol Integio (Migrate Technology Ltd.) 14SA European bee-eater MerApi PAM (Swiss Ornithological Institute) PasCir01 Purple martin PasCir Custom (by Eli Bridge) 2655 Brünnich’s guillemot UriLom Lotek Although all of these tag types record light values over time, they differ in some key details. First, tags often differ in the frequency at which they write/log data. Many tags collect a reading every minute and store the maximal light value every 5 or 10 minutes. Other may store a maximum every 2 minutes. The tag that yielded the Purple martin data set, averaged 1min readings every 10min instead of taking a maximum. These four tags also differ in their sensitivity and how they record light levels. Some tags are sensitive only at low light levels and quickly “max out” when they experience a lot of light. As such, their light-levels do not have units and are simply an index of light intensity. The Integio tags can record unique light values for all natural light levels on earth, and they store lux values that range from 0 to ~70,000. Depending on the tag type, you may have to perform some preliminary steps such as log-transforming your data or time shifting light values for sunsets (we will provide details while working on the specific datasets). Reproducing the analyses This manual contains code that can be copy pasted into an R script and executed to reproduce the results. In order to do so, you need to download the raw data as well as annotated twilight files used in this manual. The data need to be in a specific structure of folders and we do recommend you have a similar structure for your own analysis. During the processing of the data we save intermediate steps that allow us to step into the next analysis step without going through all initial and often time consuming parts. Having your raw data and your results in a well structured fomr, becomes especially important if you run analyses for many tags of the same or different species. It is also recommended that you create a single R script for each analysis (e.g. for each individual and each analysis using different tools). For example, you can name the R scripts using the tag id and the tool e.g. 14SA_SGAT.R. Since this manual is dealing with tags from different species, the following structure with sub-folders per speces (first three letters of the genus name and the species name) is setup within the main folder (called data): RawData LanCol MerApi PasCir Results LanCol MerApi PasCir RCode LanCol MerApi PasCir You can download the folders with the raw data as well as the annotaded twilight files directly via R and extract into a data folder. url &lt;- &quot;https://github.com/slisovski/TheGeolocationManual/raw/master/download/data.zip&quot; temp &lt;- tempfile() download.file(url, temp) unzip(temp, exdir = &quot;data&quot;) We also recommend using R Studio and creating a project (File -&gt; NewProject). Alternatively, you can set the working directory using the setwd function. With the data folder in your project folder (or more in general in your working directory) you should be able to run the code provided in this manual. We also recommend to use R Studio and to create a project (File -&gt; NewProject). Save the project file into the existing Data folder. This makes sure that Data is your working directory and it will remain the working directory even if the folder moves around on your drive. Alternatively, you can set the working directory using the setwd function. With the suggested folder structure and the raw data and the annotaded twiligth files you should be able to run the code provided in this manual. "],
["start.html", "Chapter 2 Getting started", " Chapter 2 Getting started To analyse light-level geolocator data in R we need a couple of R packages as well as functions that allow to run our code. We created a package called GeoLocTools that contains functions that are not nessesarily associated to a certain package but are used in this manual. Importantly the package can also run a check on you system (function: setupGeolocation()), detecting packages that are already on your computer and installs the missing tools directly from CRAN or GitHub. The package requires devtools (install if nessesary using the install.packages() function). With devtools on your system, you are able to download and built as well as install R packages directly from GitHub (e.g. GeoLocTools). library(devtools) install_github(&quot;SLisovski/GeoLocTools&quot;) You should now be able to load the package and run the setupGeolocation() function. We recommend to include this line at the beginning of each script you create for a geolocator analysis. Also check (every now and then), if there is a new version of GeoLocTools available. And if that is the case, re-install the package using the same code you used for initial installation. library(GeoLocTools) setupGeolocation() if you see “You are all set!” in your console, the function ran succesfully and you are able to proceed. Amongst dependencies, the following geolocator specific packages are loaded by this function: twGeos GeoLight probGLS SGAT FLightR What the $#@%!#!!! Although the GeoLocTools should make things much easier, it is quite common for problems to arise when setting up your environment. A few frequent and frustrating issues are: Outdated version of R. If you are not running the latest (or at least a recent) version of R, then some of the packages might not be compatible. Use sessionInfo() to see what version of R you are running. You can ususally track down the latest version of R at the R project webpage: www.r-project.org. Note that you may have to reinstall all of your packages when you get a new version of R. So expect to spend a few minutes on the update.) Missing libraries. Some packages require that you have specific sofware libraries installed an accessible on your system. if you get a message like “configure: error: geos-config not found or not executable,” you may be missing a library. Dealing with these issues may require some use of the Bash or Unix shell to install or locate a library. You can often find instructions for intalling new libraries by searching the internet, but if you do not feel comfortable installing stuff with the command line or you do not have permission to do so, you will probably need to seek some assistance from someone with IT credentials. Typos. Probably the most common error in R arises simply from typos. Even published scripts or manuals like these may contain small typos that prevent your script from running. "],
["loadingData.html", "Chapter 3 Loading data", " Chapter 3 Loading data The first step is to load your raw data into R. Different geolocator types (e.g. from different manufacturers or different series) provide raw data in different formats. And while there are functions available to read a whole range of formats, you may have to either write your own function, use simple read text utilities or get in touch with the package managers to write code that fits your format if it is not yet implemented. The most frequently used geolocators provide files with the extension .lux (Migrate Technology Ltd), .lig (BAS, Biotrack) or .glf (Swiss Ornithological Institute). The functions readMTlux, ligTrans and glfTrans allows you to read these files. The documentations of the different packages may help to provide information on how to read other files (e.g. ?GeoLight). In most cases the raw data is stored in a text file that can also be read in to R using the base function read.table(). A short note on naming and saving of data files (final results and intermediate steps): We have already discussed, that it makes sense to have a certain folder structure for the analysis of geolocators. It not only helps to keep track of all files and analysis, but most importantly it allows to run the same code for saving and reading of data once you defined a set of metadata information. With the suggested data structure, we can then define metadata information on the individual, the species, the deployment location, and define the sub-folder for saving and extracting data files. ID &lt;- &quot;14SA&quot; Species &lt;- &quot;MerApi&quot; lon.calib &lt;- 11.96 lat.calib &lt;- 51.32 wd &lt;- &quot;data&quot; By using the above metadata we can use the paste0 command to include this information in reading and writing of files. raw &lt;- glfTrans(paste0(wd, &quot;/RawData/&quot;, Species, &quot;/&quot;, ID, &quot;.glf&quot;)) names(raw) &lt;- c(&quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Light&quot;) raw$Light &lt;- log(raw$Light+0.0001) + abs(min(log(raw$Light+0.0001))) head(raw) Date Light 1 2015-07-10 00:00:00 0 2 2015-07-10 00:05:00 0 3 2015-07-10 00:10:00 0 4 2015-07-10 00:15:00 0 5 2015-07-10 00:20:00 0 6 2015-07-10 00:25:00 0 In this case it is required log transform the light data. In addition, we add a small value since the night readings are sometimes smaller than zero, values that cannot be log transformed. Adding to the confusion of different raw data types, the read functions also provide different output. However, the most important columns are, Date Light and these columns need to be in a specific format with Date being a POSIXc class and Light being numeric integers. Check if the structure of your data follows the required format with the function str. If not adjust Date format with as.POSIXct(raw$Date, tz = &quot;GMT&quot;). str(raw) &#39;data.frame&#39;: 112161 obs. of 2 variables: $ Date : POSIXct, format: &quot;2015-07-10 00:00:00&quot; &quot;2015-07-10 00:05:00&quot; ... $ Light: num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... Do I need to log-transform my raw light measurements? Log-transformation of the light intensities is helpful to visualise and inspect the data and for the twilight annotation process. It allows to focus at the low light values while seeing the whole light curve and thus makes sense for the tags that measure the full light spectrum (e.g. tags from Migrate Technology Ltd. and from the Swiss Ornithological Institute). If you proceed to analyse your data with FLightR, where you need the raw light intensities, there is no need to back-transform you light data as FLightR will do that automatically. "],
["twilight.html", "Chapter 4 Twilight Annotation Cleaning/Filtering twilight times", " Chapter 4 Twilight Annotation There are a few options for how to define and edit twilights. All tools discussed in this manual require as one of their inputs a data frame containing the times of sunrise and sunset (henceforth twilight events) for the duration of the study period. The twilight events are estimated based on a light-level threshold, which is the light value that separates day from night - values above the threshold indicate the sun has risen and values below the threshold value indicate the sun has set. There are a few options for how to generate the twilight data. twilightCalc is one function that allows transitions to be defined and is part of the GeoLight package. Given the much better realisation of this process in TwGeos, we will not discuss the GeoLight version of defining twilights. TwGeos provides an easier to use and more interactive process that is called preprocessLight. An important input, besides the raw data, is a pre-defined light intensity threshold value. How do I choose the right threshold? How do I know which threshold to use: You should choose the lowest value that is consistently above any noise in the nighttime light levels. Here, we use a threshold of 2.5, that is above any nighttime noise. However, this value is tag and species specific. For forest interior, ground dwelling species a lower threshold may be helpful, especially if there isn’t much ‘noise’ during the night. A threshold of 1 may be appropriate for such species. It is a good idea to plot (parts) of the dataset and see how the threshold fits into the light recordings: threshold &lt;- 2.5 col = colorRampPalette(c(&#39;black&#39;,&quot;purple&quot;,&#39;orange&#39;))(50)[as.numeric(cut(raw[2000:5000,2],breaks = 50))] par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = c(2, 2, 2, 2) ) with(raw[2000:5000,], plot(Date, Light, type = &quot;o&quot;, pch=16, col = col, cex = 0.5)) abline(h=threshold, col=&quot;orange&quot;, lty = 2, lwd = 2) Another useful plot can be created using lightImage; In the resulting figure, each day is represented by a thin horizontal line that plots the light values as grayscale pixels (dark = low light and white = maximum light) in order from bottom to top. a A light image allows you to visualize an entire data set at once, and easily spot discrepancies in light to dark transitions. Additionally, you can add the sunrise and sunset times of the deployment or retrieval locaitons (using addTwilightLine). This may help to spot inconsistncies in the dataset, e.g.: time shifts - resulting in a good overlap of twilight times at the beginning but a systematic shift between expected and recorded twilight times. false time zone - if the predicted sunrise and sunset times are shifted up- or downwards it is highly likely that your raw data is not recorded (or has been transformed) in GMT (or UTC). Check with producer or data provider. Furthermore, the lines can help to identify the approximate timing of departure and arrival to the known deployment or retrieval site and this may help to identify calibration periods that are required in the next steps of the analysis. offset &lt;- 12 # adjusts the y-axis to put night (dark shades) in the middle lightImage( tagdata = raw, offset = offset, zlim = c(0, 20)) tsimageDeploymentLines(raw$Date, lon = lon.calib, lat = lat.calib, offset = offset, lwd = 3, col = adjustcolor(&quot;orange&quot;, alpha.f = 0.5)) Depending on the tag type, geolocator data are automatically adjusted for clock drift by the manufacturer, or, can be easily corrected by comparing the internal device time and real time when data is downloaded. For practical reasons, clock drift in geolocators is assumed to occur at a constant rate. If geolocator data are affected by clock drift the longitude estimates during stationary periods will drift continuously in one direction. In case the tag had stopped recording before data download or the internal time stamp is obviously incorrect, clock drift can be adjusted during the process of locations estimation. In short, an estimated clock drift is added to the twilight data and longitudinal positions are (re)calculated, e.g. using a best-guess sun elevation angle. Clock drift is adequately corrected for, if the slope of a linear regression between longitude and time during stationary periods is zero, showing that there is no directional changes in longitude over time anymore. Latitude estimates are negligibly affected due to the small difference in shifting sunrise and sunset times within the same day. In the next step, we want to define daily sunrise and sunset times. preprocessLight is an interactive function for editing light data and deriving these twilight times Note: if you are working on a Mac you must install Quartz first (https://www.xquartz.org) and then set gr.Device to “x11” in the function. If you are working with a virtual machine, the function may not work at all. Detailed instructions of how to complete the interactive process can be found by running the following code: ?preprocessLight Below, we explain the major functionalities. When you run, twl &lt;- preprocessLight(raw, threshold = threshold, offset = offset, lmax = 20, # max. light valu gr.Device = &quot;x11&quot;) # MacOS version (and windows) two windows will appear. Move them so they are not on top of each other and you can see both. They should look like a big black blob. This identifies the “nightime” period over time. The top of the blob shows all the sunrises and the bottom of blob shows all the sunsets. You can note for instance that the days get longer (and thus the nights shorter) at the end of the time series, because the blob gets thinner. You may even note changes in the light image that relate to changes in activity patterns or breeding behavior. Step 1. Click on the window entitled “Select subset”. With the left mouse button choose where you want the start of the dataset to be, and right mouse button to choose the end. You will notice that the red bar at the top moves and that the second window zooms into that time period. Select when you want your time series to start and end. This allows you to ignore for instance periods of nesting. Once you are happy with the start and end of the timeseries press “a” on the keyboard to accept and move to next step. Step 2. click on the window entitled “Find twilights” and the second window will zoom in. All you need to do here is click in the dark part (in the zoomed in image i.e. the one not entitled “Find twilights”) of the image and this will identify all the sunrises (orange) and sunsets (blue) based on the threshold defined in the previous section. Press “a” on the keyboard to accept and move to next step. Step 3. This step is for adding or deleting points. If there are no missing data points, you can skip this step by pressing “a” on the keyboard. However, if you do want to add a point, you can click on the “Insert twilights” window to select a region of “the blob” that the second unintitled window will zoom into. In the zoomed window, use left mouse click to add a sunrise, and right mouse click to add a sunset. You can use “u” on the keyboard to undo any changes, and “d” to delete any points which are extra. Press “a” to move to next step. Step 4. This step allows you to find points which have been miss-classified (often because the bird was in the shade or in a burrow) and to move the respective sunrise or sunset to where it should be. Choose a point by clicking on it in the “edit twilights” window and the other window will display the sunrise (or sunset) from the previous and next days (purple and green) relative to the current sunrise or sunset (in black). Thus if the black line shows a much earlier sunset or later sunrise than the purple and green ones, it is likely badly classified. . You can then left click at the point where you want the day to start and press “a” to accept and move the sunrise or sunset. You will notice the red line then moves. Do this for as many points as necessary. Then close the windows with “q”. How important is it to edit twilights? If you have no a priori reason and criteria to strongly edit twilight events, it is generally better to be a bit conservative with editing. This prevents that data are changed into an unwanted direction, e.g. erroneously removing good data points (amidst shading events), or informative events such as strong movements. Also the criteria to edit or remove badly classified twilights will be different depending on the method you use to infer locations. For curve methods, similarity in the shape of the curve around sunrise or sunset is most important, while for threshold methods the similarity in the sunrise and sunset events itself is important.

Marker (see detailed description in ?preprocessLight) Inserted (whether this Twilight was manually inserted) Twilight3 (the original Twilight. Only different to Twilight if you edited the timing) Other processes like twilightCalc or the software TAGS produce different outputs but it is preferred to get them into this format (at least with the columns Twilight and Rise), since you can go ahead with any analysis you want using these two columns (note: do not save these two columns only, since the other information is important to reproduce your analysis). Save the output file as a .csv file, so that you never have to do this step again. To save this file we use the metadata variables that were defined above: write.csv(twl, paste0(wd, &quot;/Results/&quot;, Species, &quot;/&quot;, ID, &quot;_twl.csv&quot;), row.names = F) This can later be loaded using the following code (note, that you have to define the class type POSIXC for the date): twl &lt;- read.csv(paste0(wd, &quot;/Results/&quot;, Species, &quot;/&quot;, ID, &quot;_twl.csv&quot;)) twl$Twilight &lt;- as.POSIXct(twl$Twilight, tz = &quot;GMT&quot;) # get the Twilight times back into the POSIX. class format The result of this first part that is independent of which package/analysis will be used next is the twilight file that should at least look like (can have more columns): head(twl[,c(1,2)]) Twilight Rise 1 2015-07-15 19:34:02 FALSE 2 2015-07-16 03:01:00 TRUE 3 2015-07-16 19:43:53 FALSE 4 2015-07-17 02:51:06 TRUE 5 2015-07-17 19:48:53 FALSE 6 2015-07-18 02:46:06 TRUE Cleaning/Filtering twilight times Automated filtering of twilight times should be handled carefully. There is no perfect function that cleans your twilight file. However, twilightEdit can help to filter and remove (mark them as deleted) outliers (e.g. false twilights). The filtering and removing of twilight times is based on a set of rules: if a twilight time is e.g. 45 minutes (outlier.mins) different to its surrounding twilight times, and these sourrounding twilight times are within a certain range of minutes (stationary.mins), then the twilight times will be adjusted to the median of the surrounding twilights. if a twilight time is e.g. 45 minutes (outlier.mins) different to its surrounding twilight times, but the surrounding twilight times are more variable then you would expect them to be if they were recorded during stationary behavior, then the twilight time will be marked as deleted. The argument windows defines the number of twilight times surrounding the twilight in focus (e.g. same as in conventional moving window methods). twl &lt;- twilightEdit(twilights = twl, offset = offset, window = 4, # two days before and two days after outlier.mins = 45, # difference in mins stationary.mins = 25, # are the other surrounding twilights within 25 mins of one another plot = TRUE) In this particular case and with the parameters, four twilight times have been corrected. Based on the output, you can also exclude them for further analysis. While you can also save the output file, we recommend archiving the twilight file from above and redo the twilightEdit after reading in the archived twilight file from above. This method helps to adjust and remove twilight times that are either outliers or false twilights given a set of rules. While subjective to a certain degree as well as reproducible, the method may not be able to detect all false twilight times and may even remove correct entries during fast migration periods. "],
["GeoLight.html", "Chapter 5 GeoLight Getting started Calibration Location estimation Hill-Ekstrom calibration Movement analysis", " Chapter 5 GeoLight GeoLight uses the threshold method to estimate simple discrete locations per set of twilight events. It was developed in 2012 with the goal of being a complete, quick, and reproducible method of geolocator analysis Lisovski &amp; Hahn 2012. Over time, GeoLight has been further developed and functions such as mergeSites, mergeSites2 and siteEstiamte were added. These functions make use of a very simple movement analysis that aims to separate periods of movement from periods of residency by finding changes in the recorded sunrise and sunset times. Investigating entire stationary periods and estimating a single location (e.g., for all sunrise and sunset times during the major non-breeding period when the bird was stationary) using a optimization procedure (maximum likelihood) we can both, refine location estimates and estimate credible intervals around the most likely location. Even with these new functions, GeoLight is still a tool that uses simple principles and requires low computing capacity. It also allows for a quick analysis (that should be thoroughly checked if used for publications) and is thus an analysis tool by itself but can also be used as an initial step before going into the more sophisticated and complex approaches like SGAT or FLightR. Getting started To illustrate the GeoLight analysis, we use the Purple martin dataset. We first define the metadata and read in the raw recordings. We skip the twilight definition process but read in the file that has been generated using preprocessLight. Species &lt;- &quot;PasCir&quot; ID &lt;- &quot;PasCir01&quot; lat.calib &lt;- 33.9 lon.calib &lt;- -96.8 wd &lt;- &quot;data&quot; raw &lt;- readLig(paste0(wd, &quot;/RawData/&quot;, Species, &quot;/&quot;, ID, &quot;.lig&quot;)) raw$Light &lt;- log(raw$Light) twl &lt;- read.csv(paste0(wd, &quot;/Results/&quot;, Species, &quot;/&quot;, ID, &quot;_twl.csv&quot;)) twl$Twilight &lt;- as.POSIXct(twl$Twilight, tz = &quot;GMT&quot;) Let’s have a look at the dataset using the lightImage function from TwGeos. offset &lt;- 17 # adjusts the y-axis to put night (dark shades) in the middle lightImage( tagdata = raw, offset = offset, zlim = c(0, 4)) tsimagePoints(twl$Twilight, offset = offset, pch = 16, cex = 1.2, col = ifelse(twl$Deleted, &quot;grey20&quot;, ifelse(twl$Rise, &quot;firebrick&quot;, &quot;cornflowerblue&quot;))) As you can see, there are many twilight events that are marked as deleted. Therefore, we have to subset out twilight table. twl &lt;- subset(twl, !Deleted) # only rows that are not marked as deleted. GeoLight requires a certain input format of the twilight table that differs from the ouput of e.g. preprocessLight or TAGS. We need to have rows that always have a set of twilight times, e.g. sunrise and sunset of a day or sunset and sunrise of a night. The first columns (and the first twilight) is called tFirst, the second tSecond and the third column type defines whether it is a day (1) or a night (2). The function export2GeoLight can transform the table from above (twl) into the required format. twl.gl &lt;- export2GeoLight(twl) head(twl.gl) tFirst tSecond type 1 2011-06-21 11:06:22 2011-06-22 02:01:18 1 2 2011-06-22 02:01:18 2011-06-22 11:00:25 2 3 2011-06-22 11:00:25 2011-06-23 01:52:21 1 4 2011-06-23 01:52:21 2011-06-23 11:01:08 2 5 2011-06-23 11:01:08 2011-06-24 02:01:44 1 6 2011-06-24 02:01:44 2011-06-24 11:01:08 2 Calibration From the image above, we see that there are two clear periods when the birds has been at the release/recapture site. We can use either one period or both. Given that calibration is best if we use as many twilight times as possible, we here use both periods. We again use the ligthImage and plot the sunrise/sunset curve of the deployment site. Then we play with the dates and add lines until we are satisfied with the calibration periods. It is most important to not include any periods when the birds has not been at the known location since that can totally screw the calibration. Thus, it is preferred have a buffer to the departure/arrival. lightImage( tagdata = raw, offset = offset, zlim = c(0, 4)) tsimageDeploymentLines(twl$Twilight, lon.calib, lat.calib, offset = offset, lwd = 2, col = adjustcolor(&quot;orange&quot;, alpha.f = 0.8)) tm1 &lt;- c(as.POSIXct(&quot;2011-06-25&quot;), as.POSIXct(&quot;2011-08-10&quot;)) tm2 &lt;- c(as.POSIXct(&quot;2012-04-15&quot;), as.POSIXct(&quot;2012-05-30&quot;)) abline(v = tm1, lty = c(1,2), col = &quot;firebrick&quot;, lwd = 1.5) abline(v = tm2, lty = c(1,2), col = &quot;firebrick&quot;, lwd = 1.5) We can now subset the twilight table twl.gl. d.calib &lt;- subset(twl.gl, (tFirst&gt;=tm1[1] &amp; tSecond&lt;=tm1[2]) | (tFirst&gt;=tm2[1] &amp; tSecond&lt;=tm2[2])) The method behind the calibration function getElevation in GeoLight has changed over time and is now based in the error distribution (the variation) of the detected twilight times during the calibration period. gE &lt;- getElevation(twl = d.calib, known.coord = c(lon.calib, lat.calib), method = &quot;gamma&quot;) gE a1 e0 shape scale 93.8281938 -5.6759414 2.5305391 0.2317587 The figure above represents a nice calibration curve; the twilight error indicating the deviation from the true twilight events in minutes follows quite nicely a gamma distribution (the red dotted line). The function provides four numbers. The first one is the reference sun elevation angle (the round dot with the 1) that can be used to calculate the threshold locations. This reference angle is based on the median of the twilight error distribution, minimizing the accuracy of the location estimates (not the precision that is affected by the variability in twilight events). The second value in the output is the sun elevation angle that defines the zero deviation and thus the lowest sun elevation angle a twilight could be detected. This sun elevation angle is important in the mergeSites2 function but is also used in the e.g. SGAT analysis. The graph produced by getElevation can help to judge whether your calibration data is sufficiently long and whether it is correct. A twilight error that fits the gamma distribution is a good sign, that you have enough data for your calibration. In case you have a few bars only, the fit is poor, and your time series is probably too short. You can also use a log-normal error distribution (method = “log-norm”), in some cases this results in a better fit. Additionally, if you see a few values at zero deviation and a big gap between them and the next junk of data points you have most likely included a period that was not recorded at the known location or you have falsely defined twilight events that are earlier/later than the logger is able to detect light (go back to the twilight annotation and have a thorough look at the data). Location estimation We can now calculate the locations and have a fist look at a map by either using the implemented tripMap function or by simply plotting the locations and adding a map. crds &lt;- coord(twl.gl, degElevation = 90-gE[1], note = FALSE) ## using tripMap tripMap(crds, xlim = c(-98.75, -42.4), ylim = c(-32, 50)) points(lon.calib, lat.calib, pch = 21, cex = 1.5, bg = &quot;white&quot;) # adding the release location ## using the plot option (you need to remove the hash in front of the code) # plot(crds, type = &quot;n&quot;) # sets the extent # plot(wrld_simpl, col = &quot;grey90&quot;, border = &quot;grey50&quot;, add = T) # adds the map from maptools # points(crds, pch = 21, cex = 0.5, bg = &quot;white&quot;, type = &quot;o&quot;) # points(lon.calib, lat.calib, pch = 21, cex = 1.5, bg = &quot;firebrick&quot;) # adding the release location ven the crude location estimates of the simple threshold method provide useful information and we get a feeling of the track, the major non-breeding sites and potentially the stopover locations. We also the huge jumps, notably during migration that is most likely influenced by the equinox. However, large north-south jumps are also an indication of rapid east-west movements. Hill-Ekstrom calibration GeoLight has tools to make simple adjustments and refine the location estimates. First, we can use alternative calibration methods to see if the calibration at the known site is actually representative for the twilight error during the entire year. Assuming a fixed sun elevation angle is often not correct. Birds may behave very different during the breeding season and my use different habitat (more open or more in the vegetation). There is a good chance that this is unknown and that we cannot investigate if that is indeed the case and we have therefore make the assumption that it is the same as during the calibration period (simply assuming that is different without evidence from data is not recommended). However, in some cases we can use the s called Hill-Ekstrom calibration to estimate a reference sun elevation angle from stationary periods at unknown location. The Hill-Ekstrom calibration, is based on the theory that the precision in latitude estimates of a stationary period is highest (lowest variation) if the correct sun elevation angle has been chosen (see Lisovski et al. 2012 for more details). We can thus define stationary periods and estimate latitude using a range of sun elevation angles and see which one result in the lowest variation in latitudes. GeoLight offers a tool to distinguish between periods of movement and periods of residency. The changeLight function uses the twilight times (not the location estimates) that are unaffected by e.g. the equinox and searches for sudden changes that indicate changes in the location of the animal. If we are simply interested in a long stationary period outside the deployment/release location we can use very conservative parameters, e.g. low values for the quantile. This means that we except changes with a relatively low likelihood (e.g. 0.75). Play with the settings and you will see how this changes the separation of periods (upper panel) cL &lt;- changeLight(twl = twl.gl, quantile = 0.8) Besides other information, the changeLight function returns a vector with the sites cL$site that we can use to subset the twilight table for the e.g. longest period (in this case stationary period Nr. 5). Important, the function we use to run the Hill-Ekstrom calibration, findHEZenith, is from the TwGeos package and requires the twilight table with all twilight in one column called Twilight, and the information on whether it is a sunrise or a sunset in a second column called Rise, e.g. the output from the preprocessLight function. Using the output of the change-point analysis we can define the start and the end of the long stationary period. It is however recommended to reduce the stationary period by a couple of days at each side. This makes sure that potential movement that can be mis-identified at the transition between real movements and stopover behavior are not part of the analysis. StartEnd &lt;- range(which(twl$Twilight&gt;=(min(twl.gl$tFirst[cL$site==5])+5*24*60*60) &amp; twl$Twilight&lt;=(max(twl.gl$tFirst[cL$site==5])+5*24*60*60))) HE &lt;- findHEZenith(twl, range = StartEnd) In the plots above, you see the calculated latitudes of the entire tracking period. The latitudes have been calculated using a while range of sun elevation angels. The lower graph has the most important information; the standard deviation of the latitudes from the selected stationary period over the used zenith angle. In this case there is a clear minima (a sign that the Hill-Ekstrom calibration is working) at 94.25 degrees. We will discuss the issue of having different references for the sun elevation angle (e.g. sun elevation angle vs. zenith angle) in the SGAT section. Here, we simply transfer the zenith to sun elevation angle: 94.25 = -4.25. That means, that the optimal sun elevation angle for this period is 0.5 degrees higher than the one we estimated for the calibration period. This is not massive but still a significant difference probably explained by the non-breeding site being close to the equator with higher likelihood of clouds than in e.g. south of the US. So, let’s use this reference sun elevation angle to calculate the locations. crds &lt;- coord(twl.gl, degElevation = 90-HE) Note: Out of 592 twilight pairs, the calculation of 25 latitudes failed (4 %) ## using tripMap tripMap(crds, xlim = c(-98.75, -42.4), ylim = c(-32, 50)) points(lon.calib, lat.calib, pch = 21, cex = 1.5, bg = &quot;white&quot;) # adding the release location Movement analysis We have now put sufficient effort into the calibration and are ready to continue with the movement analysis. We again use the changeLight function but it is very important to adjust the settings until you are satisfied, and you are sure that you used a quantile value and a certain number of days (minimum days to define a stationary period), that results in a good separation between movement and resident behavior. Most importantly, you want to make sure that all movement are detected. Don’t worry of the analysis detect too many movements, we will deal with that later. The likelihood of changes (lower barplots) are relative to the biggest change. Thus, if you have strong outliers in your twilight table (false twilight times) the analysis is biased towards these outliers and you should go back to the twilight annotation process and remove strong outliers. In some cases the likelihood of changes and the variability in twilight events is very different between sunrise and sunset, if that is the case define a threshold for sunrise and sunset separately (see ?changeLight for details). cL &lt;- changeLight(twl = twl.gl, quantile = 0.78, days = 1) These settings seem to detect all changes that are obviously visible (and more). We can now use mergeSites to refine this selection and to merge consecutive sites if they are only separated by single large errors in the twilight times but are otherwise likely to be at the same site. mergeSite uses a maximum likelihood fit to optimize longitude and latitude for each stationary period. However, the error term is modeled using a Gaussian distribution and that is certainly wrong. However, the analysis often returns good results and even good estimates of the most likely location and the credible intervals. The mergeSites2 function is a further development and uses the correct assumptions (it also replaces the function siteEstimation). We can use the twilight error parameters and the reference angle that we have calculated using the getElevation function. The mergeSites2 function evaluates the likelihood surface for each stationary period, starting from the first one and compares the most likely location and the 95% credible interval with the most likely location and the credible intervals of the next stationary site. If the most likely locations are smaller than the distThreshold and the 95% credible intervals overlap, the site is merged and the process starts again from the new merged period to the next period. Additionally, we can use a simple masking option to prevent locations from beeing on land or at sea. The function requires some calculation power and can take several minutes to complete. The function returns the updated vector of the sites as well as the locations estimated using the maximum likelihood approach. … ## may take several minutes to complete mS &lt;- mergeSites2(twl = twl.gl, site = cL$site, distThreshold = 500, degElevation = gE[2]-0.75, # the HE corrected zero sun elevation angle alpha = gE[3:4], method = &quot;gamma&quot;, # parameters and model of the twilight errro mask = &quot;land&quot;) # mask option The plot created by mergeSites2 is similar to what we know from changeLight. However, the top panel shows which of the original sites were merged (red lines around dotted lines), and the same is shown for the longitude and latitude estimates in the two bottom panels. The middle panel shows the sunrise and sunset times recorded by the geolocator and the fitted sunrise and sunset times (lines) of the most likely location. We can now plot the results, using the longitude and latitude estimates of mergeSites2. data(wrld_simpl) ## create a color scale for stationary sites dependent on data Seasonal_palette &lt;- grDevices::colorRampPalette(grDevices::hsv(1 - ((1:365) + (365/4))%%365/365, s = 0.8, v = 0.8), space = &quot;Lab&quot;) ### replace first and last estimate with the deployment/retrieval location sm &lt;- mS$summary sm[c(1,nrow(sm)), 2:3] &lt;- matrix(c(lon.calib, lat.calib), ncol = 2, nrow = 2, byrow = T) sm[c(1,nrow(sm)), -c(1:3)] &lt;- NA day &lt;- as.POSIXlt(aggregate(mS$twl$tFirst[mS$site&gt;0], by = list(mS$site[mS$site&gt;0]), FUN = median)$x, origin = &quot;1970-01-01&quot;, tz =&quot;GMT&quot;)$yday stp &lt;- as.numeric(aggregate(mS$twl$tFirst[mS$site&gt;0], by = list(mS$site[mS$site&gt;0]), FUN = function(x) x = difftime(x[length(x)],x[1], units = &quot;days&quot;))$x) ## scale point of stationary periods according to the time spent on the site cexf &lt;- approxfun(range(stp), c(3, 9), rule = 3) plot(NA, xlim = range(sm[,c(2,4:7)], na.rm = TRUE)+c(-2,2), ylim = range(sm[,c(3,8:10)], na.rm = T)+c(-2,2), type = &quot;n&quot;, bty = &quot;n&quot;, mgp = c(3,2,1), xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;, las = 1) plot(wrld_simpl, add = T, col = &quot;grey90&quot;, border = &quot;grey90&quot;) lines(sm[,2], sm[,3], lwd = 2, lty = 2) arrows(sm[,2], sm[,8], sm[,2], sm[,11], lwd = 0.8, length = 0, col = adjustcolor(&quot;black&quot;, alpha.f = 0.6)) arrows(sm[,2], sm[,9], sm[,2], sm[,10], lwd = 2, length = 0) arrows(sm[,4], sm[,3], sm[,7], sm[,3], lwd = 0.8, length = 0, col = adjustcolor(&quot;black&quot;, alpha.f = 0.6)) arrows(sm[,5], sm[,3], sm[,6], sm[,3], lwd = 2, length = 0) arrows(sm[,4], sm[,3], sm[,5], sm[,3], lwd = 1.2, length = 0) points(sm[,2], sm[,3], pch = 21, cex = c(1, cexf(stp[-c(1, length(stp))]), 1), bg = Seasonal_palette(365)[day], lwd = 2) text(sm[,2], sm[,3], 1:nrow(sm), col = c(&quot;transparent&quot;, rep(0, nrow(sm)-2), &quot;transparent&quot;)) mapplots::add.pie(x = -90, y = -28, z = rep(1, 12), radius = 10, col = Seasonal_palette(12), init.angle = day[1]) In comparison, we can use the sites vector and plot all location estimates grouped into the sites using the siteMap function. siteMap(crds, site = mS$site, type = &quot;points&quot;, xlim = range(crds[,1], na.rm = T), ylim = range(crds[,2], na.rm = T)) siteMap(crds, site = mS$site, type = &quot;cross&quot;, add = TRUE) Finally, we can extract the migration schedule: schedule(mS$twl$tFirst, mS$twl$tSecond, site = mS$site) Site Arrival Departure 1 a &lt;NA&gt; 2011-08-13 06:24:43 2 b 2011-08-21 05:46:22 2011-08-22 05:51:30 3 c 2011-09-07 15:55:15 2011-10-10 03:35:25 4 d 2011-10-13 03:12:52 2011-12-12 15:03:45 5 e 2011-12-14 03:05:24 2012-02-05 15:20:55 6 f 2012-02-07 03:33:51 2012-02-08 15:33:01 7 g 2012-02-15 15:35:00 2012-02-27 15:28:11 8 h 2012-02-29 03:29:28 2012-03-21 03:24:29 9 i 2012-04-04 18:21:08 2012-05-09 18:20:37 10 j 2012-05-14 18:21:36 &lt;NA&gt; The temporal resolution of a GeoLight analysis is very low.
